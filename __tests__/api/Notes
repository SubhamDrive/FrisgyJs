Notes For Frisby
=================
Frisby is a REST API testing framework built on node.js and Jasmine.

Write Tests
Frisby tests start with frisby.create('Test Title'), where Test Title is a description for this test.

The tests are then followed by one of the HTTP methods (get, post, ..., etc). For example, .get(url) make a GET request to url.

The tests can be chained with expects after the HTTP methods. For example, .expectStatus(200) tests if the response status is 200.

The tests end with .toss() to generate the resulting Jasmine tests.

Many built-in matchers can be used to test HTTP status codes, JSON keys/values, JSON value types and others. Matchers can be found here.
